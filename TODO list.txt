GopherCAN TODO list:
 AUTO-GEN TOOL
 - Tool that will auto-generate code from the .XLSX table
 - Split up auto generated sections of .c/.h ?

 MAYBE DO
 - TCP functionality for important commands
 - double precision floats
 - Possible #ifdefs for what CAN messages/parameters each modual should handle (spreadsheet based, auto-gen)
 - Module specific variables (parameter sections, subscribe to different lists)
 - Module groups (like an email list)

 SHOULD DO
 - Quick tutorial of all of the settings needed to run CAN (CubeMX)
 - Handle hardware errors
 - General module ID for all modules (prob ID 0)
 - Use the RTR bit or a single bit of the ID of the CAN message for requests. This will change up some things involving requests but the ideas are the same
 - Requesting a parameter that is not enabled should send an error (RTR bit will fix this)

DAM/ROUTING SPECIFIC IDEAS
 - Use a routing table in service_can_tx_hardware to choose which CAN bus to put the message on (only one RX and TX buffer).
     All messages will be handled as if there is only one CAN bus, the table will choose where they are sent
 - [OR] use a routing table in tx_can_message, and have multiple TX buffers, one for each bus. Then service_can_tx_hardware
     must be called for each bus with a pointer to the correct buffer
 - Routing functionality #define
 - Have a second TX ring buffer for routing messages, give higher priority
 - Service TX hardware very frequently for message routing

 TESTS
 - [_] TEST basic RX and TX of parameters (lots of things have been changed at a low level)
 - [x] TEST to make sure buffers are working correctly
 - [x] TEST CAN commands
 - [x] TEST all datatypes (especially floats)
 - [x] TEST more usage of logic based param requests
 - [x] TEST what happens when the bus is at high load (lower priority messages will be stuck in the TX mailbox, keep the bus clean)
 - [x] TEST how the code handles full RX and TX mailboxes (TX: Waits until the next 1ms loop to send. RX: Message in position 3 is deleted for the new message)
 - [x] TEST command errors working correctly
 - [x] TEST request errors working correctly
 - [x] TEST not adding too many CAN messages into the TX buffer when it is not needed (ignoring duplicates)
 - [x] TEST lots of messages being sent to a single module at once (Its pretty good, bus is the limitation)
 - [_] TEST parameter sending function
 - [_] TEST requesting a param that is not enabled (send an error)
 - [_] TEST FIFO1 (fill up FIFO0 first)
 - [_] TEST Delta time of request vs recieve for a loaded and unloaded bus
 - [_] TEST cpu usage with no filter
 - [_] TEST module requesting data from a disabled param on another module (implement an error)
 - [_] TEST general destination CAN messages

ROUTER TESTS
 - [_] TEST basic RX and TX on different busses
 - [_] TEST RX and TX with the DAM
 - [_] TEST really full bus with lots of routing required

NOTES FOR DEVS:
 - Last_rx and HAL_GetTick() is U32 milliseconds, meaning things may break after ~49.7 days
 - If things don't seem to be working correctly, CHECK THE BUS UTILIZATION.
     Requests may not be completed if the bus is packed, returns have lower priority (this will change if the RTR bit is used)
 - Set the RX and TX buffer sizes appropriately for the expected RX and TX loads
 - Beware of asking for too many params/commands very quickly:
     The TX buffer could fill up and new requests will not be serviced (this is hard to do, TX buffer is pretty big)
     If there is a transmission issue, it is more likely the bus is full (Was not able to fill up the TX buffer under reasonable conditions during testing)
 - Good explanation of all of the HAL CAN settings:
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57094729/what-is-the-meaning-of-canbus-function-mode-initilazing-settings-for-stm32/57097908
 - Make sure to set the settings correctly when configuring in the CubeMX plugin

KNOWN BUGS:
 - They are all features
