GopherCAN TODO list:
 - Tool that will auto-generate code from the .XLSX table
 - Split up auto generated sections of .c/.h ?
 - Possible #ifdefs for what CAN messages/parameters each modual should handle (spreadsheet based, auto-gen)

 - Command to constantly request Data (add another background loop on another module)
 - Maybe use the second RX FIFO mailbox

 - Move MX_CAN_Init() to library
 - Check hcan.Init settings to see what they should be

 - [_] TEST basic RX and TX of parameters
 - [_] TEST to make sure buffers are working correctly
 - [_] TEST CAN commands
 - [_] TEST all datatypes (especially floats)
 - [_] TEST more usage of logic based param requests
 - [_] TEST what happens when the bus is at high load
 - [_] TEST how the code handles full RX and TX mailboxes

BUGS:
 - TX messages fill up and RX handling takes a long time when there are many messages to handle
 - Adding another param breaks everything
