GopherCAN TODO list:
 AUTO-GEN TOOL
 - Tool that will auto-generate code from the .XLSX table
 - Split up auto generated sections of .c/.h ?
 - Possible #ifdefs for what CAN messages/parameters each modual should handle (spreadsheet based, auto-gen)

 MAYBE DO
 - Command to constantly request Data (add a background loop function on another module)
 - Maybe use the second RX FIFO mailbox

 SHOULD DO 
 - Move MX_CAN_Init() to library
 - Check hcan.Init settings to see what they should be

 TESTS
 - [x] TEST basic RX and TX of parameters
 - [x] TEST to make sure buffers are working correctly
 - [x] TEST CAN commands
 - [_] TEST all datatypes (especially floats)
 - [x] TEST more usage of logic based param requests
 - [x] TEST what happens when the bus is at high load
 - [x] TEST how the code handles full RX and TX mailboxes
 - [x] TEST command errors working correctly
 - [x] TEST request errors working correctly

BUGS / NOTES:
 - Adding another param breaks everything
 - Requests may not be completed if the other module has a full RX or TX buffer / mailbox. KEEP THE BUS CLEAN
 - Maximum of 10 TX and RX in buffer (#defines, can be changed)
