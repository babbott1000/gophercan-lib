GopherCAN TODO list:
 AUTO-GEN TOOL
 - Tool that will auto-generate code from the .XLSX table
 - Split up auto generated sections of .c/.h ?
 - Possible #ifdefs for what CAN messages/parameters each modual should handle (spreadsheet based, auto-gen)

 MAYBE DO
 - Command to constantly request Data (add a background loop function on another module), should be a general ID that all modules will recieve
 - Use the second RX FIFO mailbox
 - TCP functionality for important commands
 - double precision floats

 SHOULD DO 
 - Move MX_CAN_Init() to library (maybe, ask other members)
 - Check hcan.Init settings to see what they should be
 - Handle hardware errors
 - Add function to send a parameter to another module
 - figure out the RX interrupts, (would almost garuntee a message that is sent is also recieved)

 TESTS
 - [x] TEST basic RX and TX of parameters
 - [x] TEST to make sure buffers are working correctly
 - [x] TEST CAN commands
 - [x] TEST all datatypes (especially floats)
 - [x] TEST more usage of logic based param requests
 - [x] TEST what happens when the bus is at high load (lower priority messages will be lost and be stuck in the TX mailbox, keep it clean)
 - [x] TEST how the code handles full RX and TX mailboxes
 - [x] TEST command errors working correctly
 - [x] TEST request errors working correctly
 - [_] TEST parameter sending function (add it first)
 - [x] TEST not adding too many CAN messages into the TX buffer when it is not needed (ignoring duplicates testing)
 - [_] TEST lots of messages being sent to a single module at once (might need ISR to make this work)

BUGS:


NOTES:
 - Last_rx is U32 milliseconds, meaning things may break after ~49.7 days
 - Requests may not be completed if the other module has a full RX mailbox. KEEP THE BUS CLEAN
 - Maximum of 32 TX and RX in buffer (#defines, can be changed. Probably could be smaller)
 - Don't ask for a bunch of params/commands at once. The thread that services the bus will not be happy
 - If things don't seem to be working correctly, CHECK THE BUS UTILIZATION. The TX mailboxes may be full
 - Make sure the STM32 and CAN transiever have a common ground
