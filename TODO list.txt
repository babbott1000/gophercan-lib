GopherCAN TODO list:
 - Tool that will auto-generate code from the .XLSX table
 - Split up auto generated sections of .c/.h ?
 - Possible #ifdefs for what CAN messages/parameters each modual should handle (spreadsheet based, auto-gen)
 - EDL communication (possibly directly to PDM)
 - Command to constantly request Data (add another background loop on another module)
 - Move MX_CAN_Init() to library
 - Check hcan.Init settings to see what they should be
 - Specify most and least significant bytes in comments
 - Handle full bus TX (better than just waiting)

 - TEST all datatypes
 - TEST more usage of logic based param requests
 - TEST what happens when the bus is at high load
 - TEST how the code handles full RX and TX mailboxes

BUGS:
 - TX messages fill up and RX handling takes a long time when there are many messages to handle
 - Adding another param breaks everything
